⚔️ OPERATION VARANGIAN: DAILY CAMPAIGN PLAN

Operator: Rip
Duration: 28 Weeks (Phase 0 - Phase 7)
Status: ACTIVE

🛡️ PHASE 0: INDOC (Weeks 1-2)

Objective: Survival in the Linux Environment.
Key Terrain: Fedora 43, Cosmic Terminal, Vim.

WEEK 1: RIGGING THE LONGSHIP (Environment)

Weekly Goal: Configure the workstation and master the terminal without a mouse.

The Strategy:
You cannot build high-performance software if you are fighting your own computer. We disable the mouse to force your brain to build a spatial map of the file system using text commands. This is how servers are managed.

Intel Drop (Resources):

YouTube: NetworkChuck - "Linux for Hackers" (Series).

YouTube: ThePrimeagen - "Vim As Your Editor".

Udemy: Linux Command Line Basics (Any highly rated course, or just stick to YouTube for this week).

Day 1 (Mon): System Setup

Task: Install Fedora 43 (Cosmic Spin).

Action: Run system updates: sudo dnf upgrade --refresh.

Action: Install the Varangian Kit (Rust, Go, Node, VS Code).

Why: Fedora is "Bleeding Edge." We update immediately to ensure we aren't patching security holes that were fixed yesterday.

Drill: Set up the Operation-Varangian directory structure.

Day 2 (Tue): Navigation Drill (No Mouse)

Concept: Absolute vs Relative paths.

Why: In a server environment (SSH), there is no "File Explorer." You must know where you are blind.

Task: Open Terminal. Create 10 folders named Sector_1 to Sector_10.

Drill: Move a file from Sector_1 to Sector_10 using only mv.

Drill: Delete all odd-numbered folders using rm.

Day 3 (Wed): The Rifle (Vim Basics)

Task: Run vimtutor.

Why: Vim is available on every server in the world. It allows you to edit text at the speed of thought.

Drill: Complete Lesson 1 & 2.

Key Skill: Movement (h j k l). Deletion (x, dd). Insert (i).

Output: Create a file vim_notes.txt using only Vim.

Day 4 (Thu): Rank & File (Permissions)

Concept: Users, Groups, and chmod.

Why: Linux creates files as "Non-Executable" by default to prevent viruses. You must manually authorize a script to run.

Task: Create a script hello.sh. Try to run it (./hello.sh) -> It fails (Permission Denied).

Action: Run chmod +x hello.sh. Run it -> Success.

Drill: Change ownership of a file using chown.

Day 5 (Fri): Watch Standing (Processes)

Concept: How Linux runs programs. PID (Process ID).

Why: When your app crashes or hangs, you need to assassinate it surgically without rebooting the whole machine.

Task: Run top or htop. Identify the Process ID (PID) of Firefox.

Drill: Kill Firefox from the terminal using kill -9 [PID]. (The -9 means "Kill immediately, do not wait for cleanup").

Day 6 (Sat): RAID - "The Blackout"

Mission: Spend 4 continuous hours using your computer without touching the mouse.

Task: Browse the web (use keyboard shortcuts), manage files, write notes.

Constraint: If you touch the mouse, do 10 pushups.

Day 7 (Sun): AAR & SOPs

Task: Review the week.

Output: Write SOP-001-FEDORA-SETUP.md in your Logbook repo.

WEEK 2: CARTOGRAPHY (Web Basics)

Weekly Goal: Understand the raw materials of the web (HTML/CSS) before using frameworks.

The Strategy:
Svelte and React generate HTML/CSS. If you don't understand the raw output, you cannot debug the generator. We strip away the magic to learn the mechanics.

Intel Drop (Resources):

YouTube: Kevin Powell - "Introduction to CSS" (The best CSS teacher on earth).

Udemy: The Complete Web Developer in 2025: Zero to Mastery (Sections on HTML/CSS).

Game: FlexboxFroggy.com & CSSGridGarden.com.

Day 8 (Mon): The Skeleton (HTML)

Concept: Semantic HTML (nav, main, section).

Why: "Semantic" tags tell search engines (SEO) and screen readers what the content is, not just what it looks like.

Task: Write a resume document using only HTML. No styling.

Check: Does it have <h1>, <ul>, and <p> tags?

Day 9 (Tue): The Uniform (CSS)

Concept: The Box Model (Margin, Border, Padding, Content).

Why: This is the #1 reason layouts break. Padding is inside the border; Margin is outside.

Task: Style the resume. Add a border to the header. Add padding to the text.

Drill: Center a div using margin: 0 auto;.

Day 10 (Wed): Maneuver (Flexbox)

Concept: One-dimensional layout (Row or Column).

Why: Old web layout (floats) was broken. Flexbox allows items to grow/shrink to fit mobile screens automatically.

Task: Play "Flexbox Froggy" (Levels 1-24).

Drill: Create a navigation bar where the logo is left and links are right using justify-content: space-between.

Day 11 (Thu): Heavy Formation (Grid)

Concept: Two-dimensional layout (Rows AND Columns).

Why: Complex dashboards need strict grids. Flexbox is for components; Grid is for page layout.

Task: Play "Grid Garden".

Drill: Create a "Photo Gallery" layout with a 3x3 grid that turns into 1xN on mobile.

Day 12 (Fri): Intel Gathering (DevTools)

Task: Open Firefox. Press F12.

Why: You can edit any website live. This is how we debug layout issues.

Drill: Inspect a news website. Change the headline text locally. Delete an ad element from the DOM.

Day 13 (Sat): RAID - "Unit Intranet"

Mission: Build a static website for a fictional tactical unit.

Reqs: Sidebar navigation (Flexbox), Roster table, Mission Statement.

Tech: HTML & CSS only. No JS.

Day 14 (Sun): AAR & SOPs

Task: Review code.

Output: Write SOP-003-HTML-BOILERPLATE.md.

🪓 PHASE 1: THE AXE (Weeks 3-10)

Objective: Build the Core Product (Rust & Svelte).

WEEK 3: LOGIC (JavaScript Boot Camp)

Weekly Goal: Learn programming logic without the distraction of UI.

The Strategy:
JavaScript is the "Latin" of the web. Even if you use Rust, you need JS to talk to the browser. We focus on logic (loops/functions) here, not making things pretty.

Intel Drop (Resources):

Udemy: The Complete Web Developer in 2025 (JavaScript Section).

YouTube: Fireship - "JavaScript in 100 Seconds" (For overview).

YouTube: Traversy Media - "JavaScript Crash Course".

Day 15 (Mon): Variables & Types

Concept: let (mutable) vs const (immutable). Strings, Numbers, Booleans.

Why: const prevents bugs by stopping you from changing things that shouldn't change.

Task: Write a script that calculates the area of a circle based on a radius variable.

Day 16 (Tue): Control Flow

Concept: if, else if, else.

Task: Write a "Bouncer" script. If age < 18, print "Deny". If age >= 18, print "Enter".

Day 17 (Wed): Loops

Concept: for loops and while loops.

Task: The "FizzBuzz" Challenge. Count 1-100. Print "Fizz" on multiples of 3, "Buzz" on 5.

Why: This is a classic interview question. It proves you understand modulo operators %.

Day 18 (Thu): Functions

Concept: Input -> Processing -> Output. Arrow Functions () => {}.

Task: Write a function convertTemp(celsius) that returns fahrenheit.

Day 19 (Fri): Data Structures

Concept: Arrays ([]) and Objects ({}).

Why: 99% of data comes in lists or key-value pairs.

Task: Create an array of "Soldier" objects (Name, Rank). Filter the list to find only "Sergeants".

Day 20 (Sat): RAID - "The Calculator"

Mission: Build a CLI script (run with Node.js).

Task: It accepts two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and prints the result.

Constraint: Handle division by zero errors.

Day 21 (Sun): Rest

Task: Study JavaScript "ES6 Syntax" on YouTube (Arrow functions, destructuring).

WEEK 4: THE EDGE (Svelte 5 Basics)

Weekly Goal: Build your first reactive Interface.

The Strategy:
We choose Svelte because it requires less code than React. It uses "Runes" ($state) which explicitly mark what data changes. This fits our "Systems" mindset: Explicit is better than Implicit.

Intel Drop (Resources):

Udemy: Svelte & SvelteKit: The Complete Guide (Maximilian Schwarzmüller).

YouTube: Joy of Code - "Svelte 5 Runes Crash Course".

Doc: learn.svelte.dev (Interactive Tutorial).

Day 22 (Mon): The Forge

Task: Run npm create svelte@latest. Explore the folder structure.

Drill: Delete App.svelte contents and write "Hello World".

Day 23 (Tue): Runes (Reactivity)

Concept: $state and $derived.

Why: The UI should update automatically when data changes. Runes tell the compiler which data to watch.

Task: Build a counter button. When clicked, the number goes up.

Day 24 (Wed): Events

Concept: onclick, oninput.

Task: Create a text box. As you type, the text appears in a headline below (Mirroring).

Day 25 (Thu): Logic Blocks

Concept: {#if} and {#each}.

Why: To show lists of items or hide secret data.

Task: Create a button "Toggle Visibility" that hides/shows a box.

Day 26 (Fri): Components

Concept: Reusable code.

Why: Don't copy-paste code. Build a "Button" once, use it everywhere.

Task: Create a Card.svelte component. Use it 3 times in App.svelte with different data.

Day 27 (Sat): RAID - "Inventory List"

Mission: Build a web app.

Features: Input box to add item. List showing items. "Delete" button next to each item.

Tech: Svelte 5.

Day 28 (Sun): SOPs

Output: Write SOP-004-SVELTE-BASICS.md.

WEEK 5: ADVANCED FORGING (Svelte Data)

Task: Make your Inventory list save to the browser so it's there after refresh.

Day 30 (Tue): JSON Handling

Task: Create a dummy .json file with fake user data. Load it and display it on screen.

Day 31 (Wed): Component Styling

Task: Style the Inventory app. Make it look like a Sci-Fi HUD using CSS Grid.

Day 32 (Thu): Transitions

Concept: transition:fade.

Why: UX (User Experience). Instant disappearance looks like a glitch. Fading looks intentional.

Task: Add transitions to your list items.

Day 33 (Fri): Deployment

Task: Create a Netlify account. Connect GitHub. Deploy your Inventory app to the real internet.

Day 34 (Sat): MILESTONE 1 - "TRIAGE CARD"

Mission: Build the frontend for the Medical Triage app.

Features: Form for Vitals (HR, BP). Visual indicator (Green/Yellow/Red) based on input.

Deliverable: A working Svelte URL.

Day 35 (Sun): Rest

Task: Review the week.

WEEK 6: THE STEEL (Rust Basics)

Weekly Goal: Survive the learning curve.

The Strategy:
Rust is strict. It forces you to handle every error and manage memory explicitly. We choose it because it eliminates entire categories of bugs (Null Pointers, Race Conditions) that plague other languages.

Intel Drop (Resources):

Udemy: Ultimate Rust Crash Course (Nathan Stocks).

YouTube: Let's Get Rusty.

Book: The Rust Programming Language (Chapter 1-3).

Day 36 (Mon): The Foundry

Task: cargo new rust_training.

Concept: cargo run, cargo build, cargo check.

Why: Cargo is your Quartermaster. It handles building, testing, and dependencies.

Day 37 (Tue): Variables

Concept: Immutability by default. let vs let mut.

Why: Rust assumes data shouldn't change unless you explicitly say so. This prevents accidental bugs.

Task: Write a program that tries to change a variable and fails. Fix it.

Day 38 (Wed): Types

Concept: i32, f64, bool, char. Static typing.

Task: Create a "Math" function that adds two i32 integers.

Day 39 (Thu): Control Flow

Concept: if as an expression (it returns a value). loop, while, for.

Task: Rewrite FizzBuzz in Rust.

Day 40 (Fri): Ownership I (The Stack)

Concept: Stack vs Heap. Copy types.

Why: This is unique to Rust. You must understand where data lives in memory to use Rust effectively.

Task: Read Chapter 4 of The Rust Book.

Day 41 (Sat): RAID - "Temp Converter CLI"

Mission: Build a CLI tool in Rust.

Task: User inputs "32 F", program outputs "0 C".

Constraint: Use std::io to read input.

Day 42 (Sun): SOPs

Output: Write SOP-005-RUST-SETUP.md.

WEEK 7: THE GRIP (Ownership & Borrowing)

Weekly Goal: Conquer the Borrow Checker.

The Strategy:
This is "The Hill." Most people quit here. We push through. The rule is simple: Data can have One Owner, Many Readers, or One Writer. Never both readers and writers at the same time.

Day 43 (Mon): Ownership II (The Heap)

Concept: String type. Move semantics.

Drill: Create a String, pass it to a function, try to use it again (Fail).

Day 44 (Tue): References

Concept: Borrowing (&). Immutable references.

Why: Moving data is destructive. Borrowing lets us look at data without taking it.

Drill: Pass a reference to a function.

Day 45 (Wed): Mutable References

Concept: &mut. The "One Writer" rule.

Drill: Modify a String inside a different function using a mutable reference.

Day 46 (Thu): Slices

Concept: References to part of a collection. &str.

Task: Write a function that returns the first word of a sentence.

Day 47 (Fri): Structs

Concept: Custom data types.

Task: Create a Marine struct with fields: name, rank, mos.

Day 48 (Sat): RAID - "Roster System"

Mission: CLI Tool.

Task: Use a Vector (Vec<Marine>) to store a squad. Functions to add a marine and list all marines.

Weekly Goal: Write code that never crashes.

Day 50 (Mon): Enums

Concept: Defining states. enum IpAddr { V4, V6 }.

Task: Use match to handle different enum variants.

Day 51 (Tue): Option Enum

Concept: Some(T) vs None. Replacing null.

Why: "Null" caused a billion dollars in bugs. Rust doesn't have Null. It has Option. You must handle the "None" case.

Task: Write a function that might return a value. Handle the None case.

Day 52 (Wed): Result Enum

Concept: Ok(T) vs Err(E).

Task: Write a division function that returns Err if dividing by zero.

Day 53 (Thu): The ? Operator

Concept: Propagating errors up the chain.

Task: Refactor previous code to use ?.

Day 54 (Fri): HashMaps

Concept: Key-Value storage.

Task: Count the frequency of words in a text string using a HashMap.

Day 55 (Sat): RAID - "Safe Calculator"

Mission: Rebuild the Week 20 JS Calculator in Rust.

Concept: clap crate.

Task: Accept command line args like ./app --name "Rip".

Day 62 (Sat): MILESTONE 2 - "SECURE LOG"

Mission: Build a CLI Journal.

Features: User types a message. App adds timestamp. App encrypts it (Caesar cipher is fine). App appends it to journal.txt.

Deliverable: A working Rust binary.

Day 63 (Sun): Rest

Task: Review.

WEEK 10: THE STRIKE (Tauri / Desktop)
