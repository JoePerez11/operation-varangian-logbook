⚔️ OPERATION VARANGIAN: GRAND STRATEGY (v3)

Commander: Rip
Mission: Build a Full-Stack Tech Firm from Zero.
Current Status: PHASE 1 (Active)

🛡️ PHASE 0: INDOC (The Foundation)

Tech: Fedora, Bash/Zsh, Vim.

💰 THE MERCENARY BRIEF (Monetization)

Immediate Income: "Linux System Administration."

The Pitch: "I can fix your broken server, secure your SSH keys, and automate your backups."

Target: Small businesses running WordPress on a cheap VPS who are terrified of the terminal.

👮 THE OFFICER'S BRIEF (Leadership & Hiring)

Role to Hire: Sysadmin / Junior DevOps.

The Test: Give them a broken laptop. Tell them to install Fedora and clone a repo using only the terminal. If they reach for the mouse, fail them.

Your Order: "Keep the fleet running. If a server goes down, I want it back up before I even know it crashed."

🪓 PHASE 1: THE AXE (Engineering Dept)

Tech: Svelte 5 (Front), Rust (Back), SQL (Data), Tauri (Desktop).

💰 THE MERCENARY BRIEF

The Hustle: "High-Performance Apps & Data Sovereignty."

The Pitch: "Stop using messy Excel sheets. I build secure, offline-capable desktop apps (Tauri) that structure your data in a real SQL database (SQLite) so you never lose a client record."

Product Idea: "The Industry-Specific CRM." Pick a niche (e.g., Roofing, Dental). Build a super-fast Rust app that works without internet.

👮 THE OFFICER'S BRIEF

Role to Hire: Head of Engineering / Lead Architect.

The Trait: Obsessive about "Safety" and "Data Integrity."

The Training: Hand them SOP-RUST-ERRORS.md. Ask them to explain "SQL Injection" and how Rust's sqlx crate prevents it at compile time.

Your Order: "The Database is the Truth. If the code corrupts the data, the company dies. Ensure strict types from the frontend all the way to the disk."

🗡️ PHASE 2: THE SCIMITAR (Security & Network)

Tech: Go (Golang), Nmap, Wireshark.

💰 THE MERCENARY BRIEF

The Hustle: "API Performance Audits" & "Penetration Testing."

The Pitch: "I can test your network for holes (Red Team) and rewrite your slow Python backend in Go to handle 10x the traffic (Dev)."

Product Idea: "The Sentinel." A Go-based microservice that sits in front of a client's website and blocks scrapers/bots at lightning speed.

👮 THE OFFICER'S BRIEF

Role to Hire: Head of Security (CISO) / Backend Lead.

The Trait: Paranoid. Cynical. Loves breaking things.

The Training: Have them hack your code. If they find a flaw you missed, hire them instantly.

Your Order: "Assume we are already breached. Lock down the perimeter. Audit every line of code the Engineers write."

📜 PHASE 3: THE SCROLLS (Intelligence)

Tech: Python, Ollama (Local AI), Vector DBs.

💰 THE MERCENARY BRIEF

The Hustle: "AI Automation Agency." (Extremely hot market).

The Pitch: "I will build a private AI that reads your company PDF documents and answers employee questions instantly. No data leaves your office (Local AI)."

Product Idea: "The Legal Clerk." A local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) app for lawyers that summarizes case files instantly using Ollama.

👮 THE OFFICER'S BRIEF

Role to Hire: Head of AI / Data Scientist.

The Trait: Creative but logical. Speaks "Math."

The Training: Show them your Python scripts. Ask them to optimize the prompt engineering.

Your Order: "Turn our raw data into money. Find patterns I can't see."

📦 PHASE 4: LOGISTICS (DevOps)

Tech: Podman, GitHub Actions, CI/CD.

💰 THE MERCENARY BRIEF

The Hustle: "Cloud Cost Reduction Specialist."

The Pitch: "You are spending $500/mo on AWS. I can containerize your app (Podman) and move it to a $50/mo server without losing performance."

👮 THE OFFICER'S BRIEF

Role to Hire: Head of Operations (DevOps Lead).

The Trait: Lazy (in a good way). They should hate doing things twice. They automate everything.

Your Order: "I want to push one button and have the code deployed to customers globally. Make it happen."

🌌 PHASE 8: THE ASCENDANT (Bonus Curriculum)

Objective: Total Mastery of the Tooling.
Prerequisite: Completion of Phase 1-7.

The Philosophy:
You have conquered the software. Now you conquer the instrument itself. You move from the "Hybrid" (VS Code) to the "Pure" (Neovim).

WEEK 29: THE MIGRATION (Lua Basics)

Concept: Neovim is configured in Lua (a scripting language).

Task: Create init.lua. Print "Hello Varangian" on startup.

Drill: Map jk to Escape.

WEEK 30: THE PACKER (Lazy.nvim)

Concept: Plugin Managers.

Task: Install Lazy.nvim. Use it to install a Color Scheme (Catppuccin or Tokio Night).

WEEK 31: THE INTELLIGENCE (LSP & Treesitter)

Concept: Making Vim smart.

Task: Install nvim-lspconfig. Connect it to rust-analyzer.

Result: You now have auto-complete and error checking inside the terminal.

WEEK 32: THE TELESCOPE (Fuzzy Finding)

Concept: Navigation without a file tree.

Task: Install Telescope.

Drill: Find any file in your project by typing 3 letters of its name.

WEEK 33: THE GRANDMASTER

Mission: Uninstall VS Code.

Task: Code your final feature using only Neovim for one week.

Reward: You are now in the top 1% of developers globally.

COMMANDER'S SUMMARY

Rip, this plan does two things:

It builds your Skill Tree (What you can do).

It builds your Company Org Chart (Who you will hire).

Every time you finish a Phase, you are qualified to hire someone to do that job for you, because you know exactly how hard it is.

Current Order: Return to Phase 1, Week 1, Day 3. Execute Vim Drills.
